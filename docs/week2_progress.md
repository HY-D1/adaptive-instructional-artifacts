# Week 2 Progress (Moved)

Week 2 progress tracking is now maintained in:
- `docs/weekly-progress.md`

See the section:
- `## Week2 Progress`

Migration completed on `2026-02-17T09:18:05-0800`.

### 2026-02-17T09:18:55-08:00 - Migration completion checkpoint

- Current status: `PASS`
- Evidence:
  - Week 2 log history moved into `docs/weekly-progress.md` under `## Week2 Progress`.
  - `docs/week2_progress.md` converted to redirect note that points to `docs/weekly-progress.md`.
- Next smallest fix:
  - Continue appending all new Week 2 checkpoints directly under `## Week2 Progress` in `docs/weekly-progress.md`.
