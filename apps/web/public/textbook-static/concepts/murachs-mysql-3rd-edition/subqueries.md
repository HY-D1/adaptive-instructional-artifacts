## Definition
Using queries nested inside other queries for complex data retrieval

## Explanation

each invoice to see if its invoice total is greater than that average. When a subquery returns a single value as it does in this example, you can use it anywhere you would normally use a single value. However, a subquery can also return a list of values (a result set that has one column). In that case, you can use the subque1y in place of a list of values, such as the list for an IN operator. In addition, a subquery can return a table of values (a result set that has multiple columns). In that case, you can use the subquery in the FROM clause in place of a table. In this chapter, you '11 learn about all of these different types of subqueries. Finally, you can code a subquery within another subquery. In that case, the subqueries are said to be nested. Because nested subqueries can be difficult to read, you should use them only when necessary.
