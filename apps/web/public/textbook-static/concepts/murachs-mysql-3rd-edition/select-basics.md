**Difficulty:** Intermediate

**Scenario:** Basic data retrieval

```sql

```

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Syntax error

**Incorrect SQL:**
```sql
SELECT * FORM users;
```

**Error Message:** `Error: near 'FORM': syntax error`

**Why it happens:** Typo in SQL keyword. The correct keyword is FROM, not FORM.

**Corrected SQL:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

💡 **Key Takeaway:** Double-check SQL keyword spelling

### Mistake 2: Missing semicolon

**Incorrect SQL:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users
```

**Error Message:** `Some databases require semicolons to end statements`

**Why it happens:** While some SQL implementations are lenient, it's best practice to end statements with semicolons.

**Corrected SQL:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

💡 **Key Takeaway:** Always end SQL statements with a semicolon
