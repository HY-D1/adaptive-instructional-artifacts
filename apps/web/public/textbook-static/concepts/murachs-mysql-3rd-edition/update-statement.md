🟡 **Difficulty:** Intermediate
⏱️ **Estimated Time:** 15 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the The UPDATE Statement concept in SQL

## What is This?

The UPDATE Statement is an important SQL concept for working with databases.

## Examples

### Example 1: SQL Example 1

**Difficulty:** Beginner

**Scenario:** Basic data retrieval

```sql
SELECT clause. Sort the final result set by the account_number column. 7. Use the UNION operator to generate a result set consisting of two columns from the users table: name and vendor_state. If the users is in California, the vendor_state value should be ''CA'';
```

**Explanation:** Example SQL statement

**Expected Output:**

| id | name | email | age | city |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Alice | alice@email.com | 25 | Seattle |
| 2 | Bob | bob@email.com | 30 | Portland |
| 3 | Charlie | charlie@email.com | 22 | Seattle |

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Syntax error

**Incorrect SQL:**
```sql
SELECT * FORM users;
```

**Error Message:** `Error: near 'FORM': syntax error`

**Why it happens:** Typo in SQL keyword. The correct keyword is FROM, not FORM.

**Corrected SQL:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

💡 **Key Takeaway:** Double-check SQL keyword spelling

### Mistake 2: Missing semicolon

**Incorrect SQL:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users
```

**Error Message:** `Some databases require semicolons to end statements`

**Why it happens:** While some SQL implementations are lenient, it's best practice to end statements with semicolons.

**Corrected SQL:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

💡 **Key Takeaway:** Always end SQL statements with a semicolon
