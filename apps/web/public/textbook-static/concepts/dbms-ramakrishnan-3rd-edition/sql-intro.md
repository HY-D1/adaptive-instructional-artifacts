## Explanation
1 OVERVIEW OF DATABASE SYSTEMS -- What is a DBMS, in particular, a relational DBMS? .. Why should we consider a DBMS to manage data? .. How is application data represented in a DBMS? -- How is data in a DBMS retrieved and manipulated? .. How does a DBMS support concurrent access and protect data during system failures? .. What are the main components of a DBMS? .. Who is involved with databases in real life? .. Key concepts: database management, data independence, database design, data model; relational databases and queries; schemas, levels of abstraction; transactions, concurrency and locking, recovery and logging; DBMS architecture; database administrator, application pro- grammer, end user Has everyone noticed that all the letters of the word database are typed with the left hand?

The issues addressed and the techniques used span a wide spectrum, including languages, object-orientation and other progTamming paradigms, compilation, operating systems, concurrent programming, data structures, algorithms, theory, parallel and distributed systems, user inter- faces, expert systems and artificial intelligence, statistical techniques, and dynamic programming. \Ve cannot go into all these &<;j
